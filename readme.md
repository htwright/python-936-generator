My first forray into cryptography. A simple windows desktop application that generates four common word passwords with 44 bits of entropy from ~10 million words from wikipedia. Created almost entirely with the Python standard library, pywin32 is used for windows copy-paste functionality. The dataset is local and the application stores no information - assuring the entropy is retained.
